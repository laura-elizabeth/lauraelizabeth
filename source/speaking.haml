          What you can expect from me as a speaker
        %p.intro
          If you're interested in having me speak to your event, here's what you can expect from me in the run up and during your conference.
        %p
          I'm available before the event to answer any questions or share talk ideas. I'll help promote your event by tweeting about it before and during.
        %p
          You can record my talk, take photos and distribute as you wish. I'll also provide you with my slides and you're free to make them available to anyone.
        %p
          I'll also be available for the full duration of the event and am happy to take part in any extras like panels, Q&A's and most social events.

          What I need from you
        %p.intro
          There are a few things that you can do to help me to do the best job possible at your event.
        %p
          Because I don't work for a company who can cover costs of me taking part in events, as a minimum I need my travel and accommodation expenses covered. Writing and rehersing talks takes a significant amount of time, so in order for me to keep doing it (and paying the bills) an honorarium is greatly appreciated.
        %p
          It's really important that you have (and enforce) a Code of Conduct at your event. Having a safe and friendly environment to speak in is essential.
        %p
          And finally, the more information you can give me about your event and your audience the better. I do reuse talks but tailor each one to your specific audience.
        %p.emphasis
          So if you think I'd be a good fit for your event, <a href="mailto:laura@lauraelizabeth.co?Subject=Wanna%20speak?">send me an email</a>â€”I'd love to hear from you!
